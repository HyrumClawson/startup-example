# Startup-Outline - FilmDefined

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been enjoying a film, taking in the gorgeous visuals, and wondered what type of techniques the director and cinematographer used to create the specific scene you're watching? Or perhaps you're hoping to go into video production and would like to get some ideas of how to shoot a scene more tastefully? Well now you can thanks to "hyrumcstartup.click" (we're still working on the name), an application where users can create personal accounts and then find, share, and save links to scenes or footage that visually define different filmic concepts. Users can involve themselves in chatgroups that discuss important film ideas, or vote for scenes that demonstrate a film quality the best. So open up a tab and navigate to "hyrumcstartup.click" today! Gee willikers that was a bit cheesy wasn't it?

* HTML - Correctly use HTML to give structure to my application. At the moment I'm planning on using 4 different HTML pages
  * A home page
  * A user's profile page
  * Uploading link page
  * Group chat page  
* CSS - I will use CSS to give style to my HTML pages through different use of colors, borders, and visuals. 
* JavaScript - Will provide login code along with displaying group chat input of others as well as the user. 
* Service - Backend service for:
  *  Login
  *  uploading footage links with description
  *  searching archive for footage links
* DB - stores user's footage links, login information, and chat responses
* Login - will allow user to access their account and their stored information. Information will not be stored unless the user has an account. 
* WebSocket - Users using group chat will see other users' input broadcast into the chat
* React - All of this will operate within the React web framework
