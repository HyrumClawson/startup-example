# Startup-Outline - FilmDefined

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been enjoying a film, taking in the gorgeous visuals, and wondered what type of techniques the director and cinematographer used to create the specific scene you're watching? Or perhaps you're hoping to go into video production and would like to get some ideas of how to shoot a scene more tastefully? Well now you can thanks to "hyrumcstartup.click" (we're still working on the name), an application where users can create personal accounts and then find, share, and save links to scenes or footage that visually define different filmic concepts. Users can involve themselves in chatgroups that discuss important film ideas, or vote for scenes that demonstrate a film quality the best. So open up a tab and navigate to "hyrumcstartup.click" today! Gee willikers that was a bit cheesy wasn't it?
