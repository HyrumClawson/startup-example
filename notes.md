## Day 1 (of using the Notes.md)

### What We Learned

Frankly I learned quite a bit from messing around with the git commit. I'm still a little fuzzy about using in VS code because there are so many random tabs and it looks so confusing. But I mostly have got it down. 

**Man oh man is it sort of a headache, but it'll be so cool when all of this becomes second nature**

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status - 
git add
git commit
```

This [link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md) takes you to some more commands and explanations/examples of ```git commands``` 


## Creating My Web Server
### My public IP address
http://52.21.167.206

**Command to SSH into my Web Server**
```
 ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
```

## Cascading Style Sheets (notes from the github repository)
* With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
* The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.
