## Day 1 (of using the Notes.md)

### What We Learned

Frankly I learned quite a bit from messing around with the git commit. I'm still a little fuzzy about using in VS code because there are so many random tabs and it looks so confusing. But I mostly have got it down. 

**Man oh man is it sort of a headache, but it'll be so cool when all of this becomes second nature**

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status - 
git add
git commit
```

This [link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md) takes you to some more commands and explanations/examples of ```git commands```

## Cascading Style Sheets (notes from the github repository)
* With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

```
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
* The selector p selects all paragraph elements in the HTML document. The four specified declarations then: 1) change the font to use a sans-serif font, 2) increase the font size to be twice as big as the default font, 3) change the text color to be navy, and 4) create a gray shadow for the text. The result looks like this.

### Associating CSS with HTML

There are three ways that you can associate CSS with HTML. The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.

```
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```

The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.

```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```
The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
styles.css
```
p {
  color: green;
}
```

All of the above examples are equivalent, but using the link element usually is the preferred way to define CSS.

### Cascading Styles

Because elements inherit the rules applied to their parents you often end up with the same declaration property applied to a single element multiple times. For example, we might set color property for all body elements to be red, and then paragraph elements to be green, and then span elements to be blue, and finally use a style element on a specific span to be black.

In this case, the rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration. You can see this happening if you use the browser's debugger.

### The Box Model 

CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/3192d429-bb8a-4a5e-b804-bdbeaee21208)

By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the box-sizing CSS property from the default value of content-box to border-box in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.

## CSS Declarations

This [link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/css/introduction/introduction.md) 
takes you to some different declarations within CSS as well as some explanations. 



## CSS Fonts

Choosing appropriate fonts is a key web application design characteristic. A beautiful modern font will make your application enjoyable to use. Picking a hard to read font, an overused font, or using too many fonts will turn users away.

The CSS font-family property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you provide with your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the @font-face rule and provide the font name and source location.

```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.woff2');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
```

If you do not want to host font files on your server, then you can load them from a font provider. For example, Google provides a large selection of open source fonts that you can use without paying any royalties. The easiest way to use Google fonts is to use a CSS import statement to reference the Google Font Service. This will automatically generate the CSS for importing the font.

```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
```


## CSS Animation

Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like at different times in the animation. Let's walk through an example.

We have a paragraph of centered text and we want it to zoom in until its size is 20% of the view height.

```
p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;
}
```

To make this happen we specify that we are animating the selected elements by adding the animation-name property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the keyframes that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence. We also add an animation-duration property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.

```
p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;

  animation-name: demo;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
```
Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We don't have to define what happens at every millisecond of the animation. Instead we only need to define the key points, and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another. In our case we simply want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords from and to.

```
@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
```
That's everything we need to do. However, let's make one more addition. It would look better if towards the end, the paragraph bounced out a little bigger than its final size. We can accommodate that by adding another key frame that happens 95 percent through the animation.

```
@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  95% {
    font-size: 21vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
```

Animation is not just for pushing buttons or making text float around. Here is an example of animating a watch using only HTML and CSS.

![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/d8e52ebe-15f0-4484-81b6-9e1a8faefa35)


## Responsive Design

Modern web applications are expected to run well on a large variety of computing devices

This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called responsive design.

Much of HTML and CSS is already fluid due to the fact that it responds to the browser window being resized. For example a paragraph element will resize when the browser window is resized. However, the following features can completely change the layout of the application based on the device's size and orientation.


We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of div elements. By default div elements have a display property value of block.

```
<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>
```
![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/ab254947-4ec1-4ba6-b05c-1993bcfa8009)

If we modify the display property associated with each element with the following CSS, then we get a totally different rendering.

```
.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```
![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/671d1045-2f6c-411b-b820-e60f64fffbe1)


### Viewport Meta Tag

Mobiile devices are used to browse websites. However, the websites were optimized for desktop displays and not little tiny mobile screens. To solve this mobile browsers automatically started scaling the website so that it looked better on a small screen. Unfortunately, as web applications started being responsive to the screen size, the mobile browser's scaling got in the way. The solution is to include a meta tag in the head element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```

### FLoat

The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

```
aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}
```
![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/8574ec92-e8f8-4d7a-a397-4315373a8836)

### Media Queries

One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the @media selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.

We can use the @media selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.

```
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  div {
    transform: rotate(270deg);
  }
}
```

![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/1112378c-0506-4bac-9b4b-8a13ca6b587c)

You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.

```
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  aside {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
![image](https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/99c92423-0c16-4c89-b618-ce6e8dfda76b)


### Grid and Flexbox

The final two responsive technologies that we want to discuss are Grid and Flexbox. These are both CSS display modes that automatically respond to screen sizes to position and resize their child elements. We will discuss each of these in detail in the following instruction.


## CSS Grid

The grid display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.

```
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
```
We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS display property with the value of grid on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The next property, grid-template-columns, specifies the layout of the grid columns. In this example we say that we want to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (1fr) of the grid width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts for each of the children.

We finish off the grid configuration by saying that we want all rows to be exactly 300 pixels high with the grid-auto-rows property and the use the grid-gap property to say that we want at least a 1 em gap between our grid items.

```
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

## JavaScript Introduction

In this instruction we will cover the basic parts of the language necessary to create a reasonable website. There are many features of the language that will not be discussed, and you should take time to dig into the corners of the language as time allows. The more effectively you understand JavaScript, the better web programmer you will be.


<img width="620" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-10 at 10 02 55 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/88f7a4c6-e9cb-4977-8a32-0c212f5d591a">

### Getting Started

Let's start with a basic example. The following JavaScript will concatenate three strings together and then throw away the result. Not very useful, but JavaScript doesn't complain much.

```
'Hello' + ' ' + 'world';
```
Only slightly more complex is to call a function with the result of our concatenated string. In this case we call the JavaScript runtime's built in function console.log to output the string to the debugger console.

```
console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'world');
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```
You can also write your own functions.

```
function join(a, b) {
  return a + ' ' + b;
}

console.log(join('Hello', 'world'));
// OUTPUT: Hello world
```
### Comments

* Just like in c++ same style. // and /* */

### Code Delimiters 
While not technically required in most cases, it is considered good form to end JavaScript statements with a semicolon (;). Code blocks, and their resulting scope, are defined with curly braces ({ }).

### Playgrounds

Before we go any further we need a way for you to write and run JavaScript yourself. There are two easy ways to do this.

1. Use an online sandbox like CodePen. With CodePen you can write whatever JavaScript you would like and immediately see the results. Make sure you display the CodePen's Console window if your JavaScript is using the console.log function.
2. Use your browser's debugger. For example, if you open Chrome and press F12 the debugger will display. Select the Console menu option. This will display a JavaScript interpreter where you can write and execute your code.



## JavaScript Console

The JavaScript console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console. This usage of console should not be confused with your operating system's console (AKA terminal or command line). The console object provides functionality for outputting the value of text and objects, running timers, and counting iterations. These are useful debugging tools when you can actually execute your code in an interactive debugger (such as VS Code).

### Log 

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.

```
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```

You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.

```
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.

```
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```

### Timers

If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with time and timeEnd calls and it will output the duration between the time and timeEnd calls.

```
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```
### Count
To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the count function.

```
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```


## Adding JavaScript to HTML

You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element, or by using the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.

index.js
```
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```
index.html
```
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

Notice that we call the sayHello and sayGoodbye JavaScript functions from the HTML in the onclick attribute of the button element. Special attributes like onclick automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.

```
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```


## JavaScript type and Construct

### Declaring Variables

Variables are declared using either the let or const keyword. let allows you to change the value of the variable while const will cause an error if you attempt to change it.

```
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```

⚠ Originally JavaScript used the keyword var to define variables. This has been deprecated because they cause hard-to-detect errors in code related to the scope of the variable. You should avoid var and always declare your variables either with let or const.

### Type

JavaScript defines several primitive types.
<img width="562" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-16 at 2 39 40 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/1a20fd74-9c62-42e6-86fa-a88a6c8897ac">

Of these types Boolean, Number, and String are the types commonly thought of when creating variables. However, variables may commonly refer to the Null or Undefined primitive. Because JavaScript does not enforce the declaration of a variable before you use it, it is entirely possible for a variable to have the type of Undefined.

In addition to the above primitives, JavaScript defines several object types. Some of the more commonly used objects include the following:

<img width="620" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-16 at 2 40 44 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/c7a930e4-1be9-4ad5-8e17-7344a630f747">

### Common Operators

When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), and === (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports + (concatenation) and === (equality).

### Type Conversions

JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.

```
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```
Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the equality operator.

```
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```
⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses complex rules for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as falsy and truthy evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.

```
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```

Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.

```
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```
It spells banana when you execute it in the google console

### Conditionals

JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes if, else, and if else. Here are some examples.

```
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```

You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact if else representation.

```
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```

You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include && (and), || (or), and ! (not).
```
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```

### Loops

JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes for, for in, for of, while, do while, and switch. Here are some examples.

#### for
Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (i++) for adding one to a number.

```
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

#### do while
```
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
#### while
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```
### for in

The for in statement iterates over an object's property names.

```
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

For arrays the object's name is the array index.

```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```
#### for of
The for of statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.

```
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```
#### Break and Continue

All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a break or continue statement to abort or advance the loop.

```
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

## JavaScript String

Strings are a primitive type in JavaScript. A string variable is specified by surrounding a sequence of characters with single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`). The meaning of single or double quotes are equivalent, but the backtick defines a string literal that may contain JavaScript that is evaluated in place and concatenated into the string. A string literal replacement specifier is declared with a dollar sign followed by a curly brace pair. Anything inside the curly braces is evaluated as JavaScript. You can also use backticks to create multiline strings without having to explicitly escape the newline characters using \n.

```
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```
### Unicode Support

JavaScript supports Unicode by defining a string as a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents UTF-16 strings. Unicode support allows JavaScript to represent most languages spoken on the planet. This includes those that are read from right to left.

However, there are several important steps you must take in order to make your web application fully internationalized. This includes handling of currency, time, dates, iconography, units of measure, keyboard layouts, and respecting local customs. Read this article on the W3C website to learn more about internationalization.

### String Functions

The string object has several interesting functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.
<img width="569" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-16 at 3 04 14 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/910bac90-2cfa-4c1d-b996-6f4605069294">

```
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```

## Functions

In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the function keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.

```
function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.

```
function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

### Function Parameters

When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is undefined when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.

```
function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
```
### Anonymous Functions

Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

```
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```

### Creating, Passing, and returning Functions

Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

### Inner Functions

Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

```
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```

## JavaScript Arrow Function

Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the arrow syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the function keyword with the symbols => placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.

```
() => 3;
```
The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

```
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

Besides being compact, the arrow function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

### Return Values

Arrow functions also have special rules for the return keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

### This Pointer

Next, arrow functions inherit the this pointer from the scope of where it is created. This makes what is known as a closure. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript scope. For now consider the following example.

The function makeClosure returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the a parameter is overridden, a new b variable is created, and both a and b are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

```
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```
Next, we declare the variables a and b at the top level scope, and call makeClosure with a.
```
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```

Now, when we call closure function it will output the values contained in scope where it was created instead of the current values of the variables.

```
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```
Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

### Putting it all Together

Now that you know how functions work in JavaScript, let's look at an example that demonstrates the use of functions, arrow functions, parameters, a function as a parameter (callback), closures, and browser event listeners. This is done by implementing a debounce function.

The point of a debounce function is to only execute a specified function once within a given time window. Any requests to execute the debounce function more frequently than this will case the time window to reset. This is important in cases where a user can trigger expensive events thousands of times per second. Without a debounce the performance of your application can greatly suffer.

The following code calls the browser's window.addEventListener function to add a callback function that is invoked whenever the user scrolls the browser's web page. The first parameter to addEventListener specifies that it wants to listen for scroll events. The second parameter provides the function to call when a scroll event happens. In this case we call a function named debounce.

The debounce function takes two parameters, the time window for executing the window function, and the window function to call within that limit. In this case we will execute the arrow function at most every 500 milliseconds.

```
window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  debounce(500, () => {
    console.log('Executed an expensive calculation');
  })
);
```
The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the windowFunc it sets a timer based on the value of windowMs. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.

The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the windowFunc it sets a timer based on the value of windowMs. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.

```
function debounce(windowMs, windowFunc) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    console.log('scroll event');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => windowFunc(), windowMs);
  };
}
```


## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) was conceived by Douglas Crockford in 2001 while working at Yahoo! JSON, pronounced like the name Jason, received official standardization in 2013 and 2017 (ECMA-404, RFC 8259).

JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.


### Format

A JSON document contains one of the following data types:
<img width="277" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-16 at 8 22 22 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/9ea1cab7-0418-4ec9-abd9-85abaa8dbebc">

Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square brackets and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.

Here is an example of a JSON document.

```
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```
JSON is always encoded with UTF-8. This allows for the representation of global data.

### Converting to JavaScript

You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the JSON.parse and JSON.stringify functions.

```
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```

Note that in this example, JSON cannot represent the JavaScript undefined object and so it gets dropped when converting from JavaScript to JSON.


## JavaScript Regular Expressions

Regular expression support is built right into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can think of them as textual pattern matchers. You use a regular expression to find text in a string so that you can replace it, or simply to know that it exists.

You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```
The string class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes match, replace, search, and split. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's test function.

```
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```

## JavaScript rest and spread

### Rest

Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number, you could write this using an array.

```
function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
```

However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

```
function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
```
But JavaScript provides the rest syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the rest of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a rest parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

Note that you can only make the last parameter a rest parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters to combine into the array.

Technically speaking, rest allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

### Spread

Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

## JavaScript Exceptions

JavaScript supports exception handling using the try catch and throw syntax. An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the throw keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime, for example, when an undefined variable is used.

To catch a thrown exception, you wrap a code block with the try keyword, and follow the try block with a catch block. If within the try block, including any functions that block calls, an exception is thrown, then all of the code after the throw is ignored, the call stack is unwound, and the catch block is called.

In addition to a catch block, you can specify a finally block that is always called whenever the try block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown.

The basic syntax looks like the following.

```
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```
For example:

```
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

⚠ When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a file not found exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a file not found exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.

### Fallbacks 

The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

```
function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}
```

## JavaScript Destructuring

Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

```
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

```
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```

This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

```
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
```
You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

```
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```
Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

```
const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
```
Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.
```
let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1
```

## JavaScript Object and Classes

A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a this pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (obj.prop) or bracket notation (obj['prop']).

```
const obj = new Object({a:3});
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```
The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term object. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. new Object()), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. {a:'a', b:2} ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

### Object-Literals

You can also declare a variable of object type with the object-literal syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```
### Object functions

Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.
<img width="374" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-21 at 3 57 05 PM" src="https://github.com/HyrumClawson/startup-example/assets/144285497/401bdcdd-6216-47db-8c50-5ff155834811">

```
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```
### Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a constructor and can be invoked with the new operator.

```
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```
Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.
```
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```


### This Pointer

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword this when we referred to the name property (this.name). The meaning of this depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the this pointer in the instruction on scope.

### Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```
You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a #.
```
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```
### Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using the extends keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the super function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the super keyword.

```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```
