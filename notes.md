# Notes.md

## Day 1 (of using the Notes.md)

### What We Learned

Frankly I learned quite a bit from messing around with the git commit. I'm still a little fuzzy about using in VS code because there are so many random tabs and it looks so confusing. But I mostly have got it down. 

**Man oh man is it sort of a headache, but it'll be so cool when all of this becomes second nature**

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status - 
git add
git commit
```

This [link](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md) takes you to some more commands and explanations/examples of ```git commands```
